# cs-class-game-assignment
Simple game for one of my first cs classes. Uses FLTK.

Notes
-----

There are 2 very simple levels. This assignment took a few weeks, so I couldn't get very far but the idea is there. It was pretty cool to learn how collisions are handled and hardcode the boundaries for these 2 levels. Definitely would not go this route if I was doing this over. Also, the game is mostly in 1 file... which is terrible. I plan to update that if I get a chance.
